# Advanced Box Shadow CSS Generator 
The box-shadow property attaches one or more shadows to an element. This helps create a variety of interesting effects and illusions to any user interface. However, this property can be quite difficult to adjust, requiring minute changes to values just to achieve the desired effect.<br/> <br/>
This is why I decided to develop the Advanced Box Shadow CSS Generator. This front-end tool can help you adjust the values easily, and when you're satisifed with the result, just copy the generated line of code into your own code. <br/>
